#  admin-toolkit helps to harden your pi, install other packages easily, and add files out of the box.
#  Some things require a user to be added and others dont. Some things are indended to be used with FullPageOS
#  and the scripts that come with it, but there are uses outside of that, if you edit a bit of code.
#  This has only been used with FullPageOS, and Raspbian Buster on a pi4

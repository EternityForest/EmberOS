# Try three extremely common LAN addresses for the router, it might have an NTP server built in
# Which might be local and therefore preferable.  These addresses are safe-ish because they are almost always
# owned by the router/ap, not some other random device that could be another EmberOS node broadcasting false time.

# We also set minstratum 13 on them so it won't trust them.  Really this is kind of just a possible fallback.
